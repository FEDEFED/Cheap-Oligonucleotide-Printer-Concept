# Cheap Oligonucleotide Printer Concept
The concept used is to protect dNTP molecules with Na<sup>+</sup> ions, do a single joining via a TdT protein, and using HCl to remove the Na<sup>+</sup> ions.

Procedure (ideal):<br />
-Mix baking soda and dNTP to get dNTP sodium salt, carbon dioxide and water<br />
-The 5' site of the dNTP salt is blocked so the nucleotides will be added in a 3'->5' fashion<br />
-The salt is itroduced into a solution of a backbone DNA and TdT, contained in a beaker A<br />
-A is cleaned from excess salt<br />
-HCl is added to A<br />
-A is cleaned from excess HCl

Procedure (next attempt):<br />
-Mix baking soda and dNTP to get dNTP sodium salt, carbon dioxide and water<br />
-The 5' site of the dNTP salt is blocked so the nucleotides will be added in a 3'->5' fashion<br />
-The salt is itroduced into a solution of a backbone DNA and TdT, contained in a beaker A<br />
-HCl is added to A

Next attemp hardware setup:
In order to mix the substance five headphone speakers are mounted on the plug of five eppendorf provettes (NaSdATP, NaSdTTP, NaSdCTP, NaSdGTP and HCl), with a hole so small that without a pressure increase the liquid can't escape via surface tension, disposed such that the drop falls into an open central provette.

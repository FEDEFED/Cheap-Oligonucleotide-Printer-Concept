# Cheap Oligonucleotide Printer Concept
The concept used is to protect dNTP molecules with Na<sup>+</sup> ions, do a single joining via a TdT protein, and using HCl to remove the Na<sup>+</sup> ions.\n
Procedure\n
-Mix baking soda and dNTP to get dNTP sodium salt, carbon dioxide and water\n
-The 5' site of the dNTP salt is blocked so the nucleotides will be added in a 3'->5' fashion\n
-The salt is itroduced into a solution of a backbone DNA and TdT, contained in a beaker A\n
-A is cleaned from excess salt\n
-HCl is added to A\n
-A is cleaned from excess HCl<br />
